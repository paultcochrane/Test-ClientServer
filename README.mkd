Test::ClientServer
==================

This is a Perl 6 module to make tests involving network daemons and whatnot a bit easier to write
and understand. It works by poorly emulating a fork using bash commands, and then running
server/client code blocks in the child processes. Read `t/simple-socket.t` for an example of how to
use it.
